asy_jpcache is Full Page Caching for Textpattern1.0 rev.300 and up (including RC5).

Install asy_jpcache.txt in the Admin-Panel, and click on _help_ to view the installation instructions.

Installation
----------------

1. Copy the directory jpcache and its contents into your main directory. It should be right next to your images and your textpattern directory (on a default install).
Make sure that the jpcache/cache directory can be written to. Usually chmod 777 jpcache/cache/ will do the trick.
2. Edit your index.php in the main directory and before include txpath.'/publish.php'; insert the following line: include './jpcache/jpcache.php'; (IMPORTANT: do NOT edit textpattern/index.php )
3. Donâ€™t forget to activate this Admin-plugin.
4. Optional: Look inside jpcache/jpcache-config.php to change a few settings, like enabling Debugging, permanently turning off gzip-encoding, change timout etc.
